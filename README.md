<h2 align="center">About 📖</h2>
   
<p align="center"> 

   This is a simple note app, very basic and focused on introducing Dart and Flutter, and most importantly, on creating a more solid base to introduce the next chapters.<br>
   This app was made on Rocketseat's Ignite program. 💜🚀

<h2 align="center">Challenges and Learnings along the way 🤯</h2>

<p align="center"> 

      Despite being a very basic app, this project made me review several very important and essential concepts, a foundation will always be essential. I enjoyed developing this app, and knowing that it is simple and that I was able to follow normally, for sure if it was a few months ago, I would have a lot of doubts, but this one, I didn't have any and I could explain what I did to anyone.
